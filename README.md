The worldpay-RAFT-commercetools-connector module provides integration between commercetools and the Worldpay Native RAFT API, to minimize implementation timescales, and client-side configuration required. It supports the following use cases:


* Payment Authorization through the creditAuth API using eProtect for the following payment methods:
    * Credit Card
    * Google Pay
    * Apple Pay
    * PINLess Debit
* Payment Cancellations (part and full) through the creditAuth API specifying reversal attributes.
* Payment Completions (part and full) through the creditCompletion API.
* Refunds (part and full) through the creditRefund API.
* Gift Card Transactions through the Gift Card API:
    * Gift Card Inquiry	
    * Gift Card Pre Authorization
    * Gift Card Pre Authorization Reversal
    * Gift Card Completion
    * Gift Card Refund

In addition to the above use cases, the module source code repository provides:

* Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) cloud deployment templates for easy provisioning into a clientâ€™s cloud infrastructure.
* A suite of unit and integration test components.

#### Integration Approach

The integration approach leverages commercetools API Extensions to transform payment create / update API calls via the Worldpay RAFT Connector module between commercetools and Worldpay RAFT.

The below diagram shows an overview of the steps within the journey to create / update a payment, whilst utilizing eProtect to reduce PCI liability. This will form the backbone of the infrastructure covered within this document.
